## Summary:

-Analysis of the Employee Survey Dataset reveals several key trends:

-Overall Satisfaction: A majority of employees reported moderate-to-high satisfaction, though a notable portion expressed dissatisfaction in specific areas.

-Work-Life Balance: Responses show a mixed experience â€” some employees appreciate flexibility, while others cite workload as a major stressor.

-Management & Leadership: Feedback indicates that direct supervisors are generally supportive, but communication from upper management could be improved.

-Compensation & Benefits: Many employees feel compensation is fair but not fully competitive, with benefits cited as an area for potential enhancement.

-Career Development: Opportunities for growth and training are frequently mentioned as a concern, particularly among younger employees seeking advancement.

-Engagement Levels: Highly engaged employees are more likely to report positive views of management, fair recognition, and clear career paths.
